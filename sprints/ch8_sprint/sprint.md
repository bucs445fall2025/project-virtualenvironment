## Sprint 8 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

Updated requirements names to more accurately reflect a problem rather than a solution.

### User Story

N/A 

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

We attempted to do the Undo/Redo Requirement and the 
Allow User to Export images requirement, however, we were not able to complete these requirements and will be using a technical flex.

### Completed Requirements

N/A

### Incomplete Requirements

We were not able to implement the Undo/Redo functionality and the Export Images functionality. We were however able to set up a Node.js/Express server and containerize it with Docker. We also need to work on the actual drawing logic as that doesn't work.

### The summary of the entire project

Currently, we have what we had last time, a UI and the logic for drawing as well as a couple of tools. We now also have the framework for a node.js server.
