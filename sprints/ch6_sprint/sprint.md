## Sprint 7 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

N/A

### Requirement Target

Pretty GUI Requirement

### User Stories

gui_design

### Planning

Justin has already done some work on the GUI, we will all take a look at it as well to make suggestions and such,
I don't think there will need to be any unit tests implemented for the GUI. 

### Action Items

- Initial GUI layout
- Meeting to discuss GUI, and any potential changes
- Finalized GUI. 
- If there are any tests, should be implemented

### Issues and Risks

- This sprint is relatively straightforward, can't think of too many issues.
- Might be an issue in separating GUI logic from the actual logic of the canvas. 

### Team Work Assignments

Theo- Administrative work, unit tests, SRS
Brendan - Further work on backend logic, maybe optimize renderer or improve layers
Justin - Implement GUI, present to team for feedback.
