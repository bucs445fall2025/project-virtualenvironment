## Sprint 5 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt


### Requirement Target

- Simple Draw on Canvas

### User Stories

Also "simple_art"

### Planning

Our plan is to meet once during the beginning of the week to fully flesh out and delegate the tasks, then reconvene towards the end of the sprint, hopefully with everything done, and hash out our sprint file. If we run into any difficulties we might set up a "hack session"

### Action Items

- Drawing Logic, tracking the points a user drags over with his mouse
- Rendering Logic, rendering these points a user drags over
- Front-end UI: There should be a central canvas that a user can draw on

### Issues and Risks

- The difficulties of working with WebGL might be a  confounding factor
- Figuring out exactly how to track mouse movement also seems like it could be a difficult task

### Team Work Assignments
(Tentative)
- Brendan: Finish implementing basic rendering, Front-End UI
- Justin: Rendering Logic
- Theo: Drawing Logic
