## Sprint 7 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

Updated UI Section, also added undo/redo and export images Requirements

### User Story

GUI design user story

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

Pretty GUI

### Completed Requirements

We've essentially completed Pretty GUI, there are some issues left to be hashed out, but the general GUI is planned.

### Incomplete Requirements

The logic for drawing the canvas is off in the fully implemented GUI, additionally we are making some changes to the color picker. 

### The summary of the entire project

Currently we have a canvas, the logic and functionality for simple drawing on that canvas, a couple of tools, and a UI for the website.

## Sprint 8 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

Pretty UI, we still need to hash out some issues with hooking the UI up to the logic, and getting the canvas to work.

### Requirement Target

Undo/Redo Functionality

### User Stories

Save_artwork, simple_art

### Planning

We will first try and fully hash out the issues we are running into for the UI, then I anticipate undo/redo taking longer than export since it is more complicated. Brendan said he's comfortable with primarily focusing on these issues. Justin will continue to perfect the UI, while Theo will dockerize the app, as well as try and fix the issue with the canvas not drawing on the new UI

### Action Items

- Get the UI to the place we want it to be at, hash out remaining problems
- Implement Undo/Redo Functionality
- Implement Export Functionality
- Add Containerization
- Add relevant unit tests

### Issues and Risks

- Canvas issue is fairly complicated, might take some time to figure out
- Undo/Redo also seems like there could be some issues we run into

### Team Work Assignments

Brendan - Undo/Redo, Export Artwork
Justin - Continue Working on UI
Theo- Dockerize app, try and fix issue with canvas not working on new UI
