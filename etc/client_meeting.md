**Interviewed By:** Theo Fahey

### **Client Overview**
- **Brief description of the client and their background:**
  (Example: Kevin is a Dungeon Master who wants a tool to help manage his D&D campaigns.)
  Justin is a casual artist who would like the ability to create, edit, and colaberate on digital art on the web

- **Client’s main goal for the software:**
  (Example: The tool should help track player turns, roll dice automatically, and send notifications.)
  The software should be responsive and reliable and be a convienent way to create digital art (not having to download anything)

---

### **Interview Questions & Responses**

#### **1. What are the costs vs. budget?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I don’t want to spend much, ideally free, but I’d consider paying a one-time fee.")
We do not have much money so this should be built for free. I dont want anything that will destroy my budget. There are many other digital art development programs that do that already. Maybe id pay for better features and certain colaberation features but not the basics. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: The client is looking for a free tool but may accept optional paid features.)
The program should be free. Maybe optional paid version for premium features.

#### **2. What is the timeframe for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I need this ready before my next campaign starts in three months.")
I need this project to be fully working and completed by early december. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: A strict deadline, must focus on core features first.)
This deadline is absolute. Focus on core functionality and performance first.

---

#### **3. What problem are you trying to solve?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Managing initiative order and tracking actions is too slow.")
There are not good web based art creation platforms. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
Work like art platforms on desktop but web based. 

---

#### **4. What is the most important feature?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Initiative tracking needs to be easy and automatic.")
The brush tool should be responsive and work well. I want the brush to be accurate and I want it to be professional quality. It would be nice to have layers and additional tools but draw, erase, shapes, undo/redo, and layers are my first priorities

**Clarification & Notes:**
- The features above should be the core features that are focused on first
- Additional features should be: web based colaberation, image interaction, more brushes, lasso tools..

---

#### **5. Is there a similar product on the market?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Yes, but they are either too complex or too expensive.")
Yes but most are desktop based which requires downloading software. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Competitor analysis needed.
- Make it simplistic but efficent and effective. Low cost and low overhead

---

#### **6. Are there any existing products or technologies that will need to be integrated?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "It would be nice if it worked with Roll20 or D&D Beyond.")
It would be cool if like you could save the art you make to your google drive or computer or something and be able to import from google drive or some cloud service

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Check for **APIs** for possible integrations.
- Consider a **manual import/export** feature if full integration isn’t feasible.

---

#### **7. What does success look like for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "If my players can see whose turn it is without me saying anything, that’s a win.")
Ability to create a piece of art, save it, modify it, share it, and design it to the full capabilities of the users imagination with speed and low overhead or setup requirements

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Focus on visual clarity
- Fast design
- Robust well tested features

---

#### **8. What risks are associated with a malicious user?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Not much, unless players try to cheat dice rolls.")
If there is a colaberation feature that could lead to issues of someone malicious accessing a document and altering it


**Clarification & Notes:**
- Consider validation checks to make sure only certain people can access files
- User accounts?

---

#### **9. What is the expected lifetime of this software?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I want to use it for many campaigns, so it should last for years.")
This software should be stable and work indefinitely 

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Add more and more features as see fit

---

#### **10. What additional features would you like?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "A way to send private messages to players would be cool.")
It would be cool to add more image manipulation tools over time

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Nice-to-have, but **not essential** for version 1.

---

## **Key Takeaways & Next Steps**
- **Most important feature:** Responsive drawing tool
- **Secondary features:** Shape creation, layers, images
- **Deadline:** December
- **Risks:** Potential lag, malicous users accessing files

### **Next Steps:**
✅ Prioritize initial canvas and UI
✅ Research existing products for inspiration
✅ Create initial create + save document feature
✅ Create brush / erase tool
