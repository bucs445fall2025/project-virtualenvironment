# Importing Tools
## **User Story**
As a Advanced Artist, I want to be able to import my own artistic tools into the project

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- The user should be able to import some kind of artistic tool (with a certain file type)
- These tools will be limited to the extent where they would just define logic for modifying pixel data
- Other user's should be able to see the changes this tool makes without necessarily having access to the tool itself
---

## **Notes**
- Maybe instead of importing a tool, we would have a custom tool that the user can make as I'm not sure exactly how importing a tool would work.
