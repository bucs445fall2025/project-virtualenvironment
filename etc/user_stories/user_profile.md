# User Profiles

## **User Story**
As a casual artist,
I want to create a user profile on this website
so that I can access all my saved art
---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- User has the option to create a profile on the website, making the user choose a username and password.
- The system must store this login data, so that it can validate and ensure a user can subsequently login.
- The user can sign in and sign out of their user profile.
- When logged in to user profile, a user can access all of their previously saved artwork

---

## **Notes**
- Perhaps in the future we can add more features to the profile such as friends or a personal bio
- We should also associate each account with an email so that users can reset their password
