# GUI

## **User Story**
As an artist who values simple, yet artistic design,
I want access to a clean art sight that is styled artistically yet simple and intuitive,
so that I can make my art in an aethetically pleasing setting

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Each artistic tool will have a custom drawn icon
- Website interface will be simple, yet artistic, reflecting the theme of the site

---

## **Notes**
- UI is obviously not fully layed out yet, and we can only speculate on a very vague "theme"at this point. 
- [Potential risks or challenges]
