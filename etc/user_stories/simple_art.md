# Basic Drawing Features

## **User Story**
As an artist,
I want a simple, intuitive, yet still expansive web art platform
so I can create art projects without sacrificing too much in terms of design complexity

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- User will have access to a canvas, which consists of thousands of pixels
- Canvas will be rendered in response to user input 
- Canvas will resize and allow users to zoom in and out
- User will have access to a number of artistic tools such as a paintbrush, eraser, shape tool, etc. 
- A custom cursor is be displayed for each tool

## **Notes**
- Probably the most expansive task as it involves implementing the essential functionality of an art app
- [Potential risks or challenges]
