# Saving/Loading Art

## **User Story**
As a casual artist, 
I want a way to save and load my artwork(both locally and on the website)
so that I can take a break from drawing and pick up where I left off, or, so I can print or export my art to a different program
---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- User will be able to click some "save" button which will save the artwork on the website itself.
- User will be also be able to export the drawing as an image (.png or .jpg maybe), or as a raw data file containing the raster data. 
- User will be able to load a raw raster data file, or load a project that's saved to their profile on the website


---

## **Notes**
- Users should be able to save projects, even if they aren't the creator of the project
- Doesn't seem feasible to load an image file such as a jpg or png, but maybe something we could implement in the future
- When loading, the raster file being uploaded must match our way of storing raster data.
